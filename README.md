During my PHP and SQL exam, I achieved a **perfect score of 10**, which was a great accomplishment for me. The exam focused on **database management, SQL queries, and form handling**, requiring a deep understanding of how PHP interacts with MySQL.  

Thanks to my dedication and countless hours of practice, I was able to complete every task efficiently, ensuring that my code was **clean, functional, and well-structured**. This result reflects my strong grasp of **PHP and SQL** and motivates me to continue improving my programming skills.  

I've even uploaded the exam to **GitHub** so others can check out my work and see how I approached each challenge. Itâ€™s always great to share knowledge and learn from others in the community! ðŸš€

I am open to receiving advice and help if you want!
